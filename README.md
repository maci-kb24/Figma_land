# Figma Land

Startup landing page build with Bootstrap 5.

Live site - [https://figma-land-startup.netlify.app/]

# Challenge

The challenge was to customize the site, i can see that Bootstrap is not ideal for custom designed project, it's better siuted for a prototype. It can be customized but it require more work and more css which defeats the purpose of using an framework.

In this sense, i find Tailwind better suited for customizing.

## Run the project

Clone the repo and run the site in your browser

```
gh repo clone maci-kb24/Figma_land
```
